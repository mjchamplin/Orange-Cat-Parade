In 2022 I created a Patreon with the goal of *making a zine every month*.

I have a storied history of engaging in "<em>do _____ every _____ challenges</em>" &mdash; see: 
National Novel Design Month([NaNoDeMo](https://blog.mjchamplin.com/2019/12/nanodemo/)), 
[Inktober](https://blog.mjchamplin.com/2019/12/inktober/), 
[]()
etc.

I didn't end up making 12 zines, but I did have a great little following on Patreon (thanks to all who subscribed there) and created a number of things I'm proud of. This site exists to archive the zines and various weird things I made.
